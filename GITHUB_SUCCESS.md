### Reddit Post (r/MachineLearning, r/learnmachinelearning)

**Title**: `[P] LendSafe - FCRA-compliant loan explainer using fine-tuned IBM Granite 350M`

**Body**:
```
I built LendSafe, an AI system that generates regulatory-compliant explanations for loan decisions.

**The Problem**: Financial institutions need to explain AI credit decisions (FCRA requirement), but most solutions cost $10K+/month and send data to third parties.

**My Solution**:
- Fine-tuned IBM Granite 350M with LoRA (644KB adapters)
- 100% local processing (privacy-first)
- <2GB RAM, runs on laptop
- $0 operational cost

**Tech Stack**:
- Model: IBM Granite 4.0 H 350M
- Fine-tuning: PEFT/LoRA (r=8)
- Frontend: Streamlit
- Deployment: Local or Streamlit Cloud

**Performance**:
- Inference: 5-10 seconds per application
- Memory: <2GB RAM
- Quality: Coherent, professional explanations

## 📊 Portfolio Impact

### Resume Bullet Points

```
✓ Fine-tuned IBM Granite 350M (LLM) for financial compliance using PEFT/LoRA,
  achieving 99.9% parameter reduction (644KB vs 700MB) while maintaining quality

✓ Built full-stack AI application with Streamlit generating FCRA-compliant
  loan explanations in <10 seconds with <2GB memory footprint

✓ Implemented privacy-first ML system processing loan decisions locally with
  zero API costs, suitable for regulated financial institutions

✓ Developed comprehensive testing and documentation suite for production
  deployment across multiple platforms (local, Streamlit Cloud, Docker)
```

### Cover Letter Mention

```
In my recent work on LendSafe, I addressed a critical challenge in financial
services: explaining AI-driven credit decisions to meet FCRA regulatory
requirements. I fine-tuned IBM's Granite 350M model using parameter-efficient
techniques (LoRA) to generate compliant explanations while running entirely
on-device, ensuring data privacy and eliminating API costs. This project
demonstrates my ability to apply cutting-edge ML techniques to solve real-world
business problems while balancing technical constraints, regulatory requirements,
and user experience.
